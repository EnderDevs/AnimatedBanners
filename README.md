# AnimatedBanners
if a user does /banner create <delay> (How fast the animations go) and is holding a banner it will:

say "Successfully entered banner create process, Please do /banner frame to make a keyframe. Do /banner finish when done."

You do all of that and once you do /banner finish, it makes your banner flash those keyframes you made every <delay> seconds when placed?
